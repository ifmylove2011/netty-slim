 * This is a weakened version of the MPSC algorithm as presented

 * 1024 Cores</a> by D. Vyukov. The original has been adapted to Java and it's quirks with regards to memory
 * model and layout:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Use inheritance to ensure no false sharing occurs between producer/consumer node reference fields.
 * <li>As this is an SPSC we have no need for XCHG, an ordered store is enough.
 * </ol>
 * The queue is initialized with a stub node which is set to both the producer and consumer node references.
 * From this point follow the notes on offer/poll.
